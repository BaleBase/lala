## Solution File: Log Size Management

In this activity, you are a junior administrator at Rezifp Pharma Inc. The company maintains a large database of patient data associated with patients, doctors, and their treatments. These files are maintained on a local server.

The primary benefits of log rotation are preserving log entries and keeping log file sizes manageable. When a log file is rotated, the preserved log file can be compressed to save space.

You will create a log rotation scheme that keeps four weeks' worth of logs with a daily rotation that includes a maximum file size of 1 GB.

The goal of this activity was to learn how to edit the logrotate configuration file and establish a log rotation scheme based on a specific set of criteria. Since system logging daemons do not allow us to control log file sizes, we use a tool like Logrotate to fill this gap.

### Solutions

In your Ubuntu VM, launch a terminal. 

1. Verify you have the most up-to-date version of logrotate installed. 

    - Run `sudo apt install logrotate`

      ```bash
      [sudo] password for sysadmin:
      Reading package lists... Done
      Building dependency tree
      Reading state information... Done
      logrotate is already the newest version (3.11.0-0.1ubuntu).
      ...
      ...
      ```
      
- **Note:** Your version may slightly differ. 


2. Configure the following default parameters for logrotate by editing `/etc/logrotate.conf`: 

   - A rotation scheme keeping four weeks of backlogs.

   - Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` and add the following update: 

        -	Implement a rotation scheme to keep four weeks of backlogs.

            ```bash
            # Keep 4 weeks of backlogs
            rotate 4
            ```

   - Create new empty log files after rotating old ones.

            ```bash
            # Create new (empty) log file after rotating old ones
            create
            ```

   - Do not rotate empty logs.

            ```bash
            # Do not rotate empty logs
            notifempty
            ```

   - Compress log files.

            ```bash
            # Compress log files
            compress
            ```

3. List the contents of `logrotate.d` to see what configuration files are present.

     - Run  `ls -lat /etc/logrotate.d`

        ```bash
        total 76
        drwxr-xr-x 142 root root 12288 Apr 30 04:38 ..
        drwxr-xr-x   2 root root  4096 Apr 29 10:47 .
        -rw-r--r--   1 root root   442 Jul 16  2019 apache2

        -rw-r--r--   1 root root   173 Apr 20  2018 apt
        -rw-r--r--   1 root root   329 Apr  6  2018 nginx
        -rw-r--r--   1 root root   181 Mar 27  2018 cups-daemon

        -rw-r--r--   1 root root    79 Jan 16  2018 aptitude
        -rw-r--r--   1 root root   501 Jan 14  2018 rsyslog
        -rw-r--r--   1 root root   533 Dec 15  2017 speech-dispatcher
        -rw-r--r--   1 root root   126 Nov 20  2017 apport
        -rw-r--r--   1 root root   120 Nov  2  2017 alternatives
        -rw-r--r--   1 root root   112 Nov  2  2017 dpkg
        -rw-r--r--   1 root root   178 Aug 15  2017 ufw
        -rw-r--r--   1 root root   126 May  7  2014 vsftpd

4. In `/etc/logrotate.d`, add configurations for the following directories:

    - For the log rotation rules for `/var/log/auth.log`, use the following parameters: `180 days of backlog`, `rotate daily`, `Don't rotate empty logs`, `Compress the file`, `Delay the compression`. Name the configuration file `auth`.

    - Run `nano auth` to create a new file. 
    
    - Add the following contents: 

        ```bash
        /var/log/auth.log {
            rotate 180
            daily
            notifempty
            compress
            delaycompress
            endscript
        }
        ```
     - Save and exit the file. 
    
    - For the log rotation rules for  `/var/log/cron.log`, use the following parameters: `60 days of backlog`, `rotate daily`, `Don't rotate empty logs`, `Compress the file`, `Delay the compression`. Name the configuration file `cron`.

     - Run `nano cron` to create a new file. 
    
     - Add the following contents: 


        ```bash
        /var/log/cron.log {
            rotate 60
            daily
            notifempty
            compress
            delaycompress
            endscript
        }
        ```
     - Save and exit the file. 

    - For the log rotation rules for  `/var/log/boot.log`, use the following parameters: `30 days of backlog`, `rotate daily`, `Don't rotate empty logs`, `Compress the file`, `Delay the compression`. Name the configuration file `boot`.

     - Run `nano boot` to create a new file. 
    
     - Add the following contents: 

        ```bash
        /var/log/boot.log {
            rotate 30
            daily
            notifempty
            compress
            delaycompress
            endscript
        }
        ```
     - Save and exit the file. 

#### Bonus

5. Test the rotation by forcing logrotate to rotate the logs by verifying the dates.

    - Make sure that the proper lines are un-commented in the `etc/lograte.conf` file. 

   - Run `sudo logrotate -vf /etc/logrotate.conf`. If you see `old log` in the output, run the command again until you see `rotating pattern` in the output.
