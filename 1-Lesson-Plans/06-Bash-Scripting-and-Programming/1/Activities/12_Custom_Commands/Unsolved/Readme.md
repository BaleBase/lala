## Activity File: Custom Commands

- In the previous activity, you created your first bash script. It contained a series of commands that should save you time during your system audits.

- In this activity, you will continue to make this script more complex by adding a few commands from the first exercise.

- As a bonus, you will save this script to a `scripts` directory and add that directory to your `$PATH` so you can call your script directly on the command line, from any directory.

Completing this activity will require the following:

- Ensure your script from the last activity runs as expected.

- Copy the script to a new file called mk_sys_info.sh.

- Add the new commands listed or modify existing commands in the instructions to your script.

- Move your script to a `~/scripts` directory as `sys_info.sh`.

- Add your `~/scripts` directory to your `$PATH`.

- Run your script to verify it produces the correct output.

#### Instructions

Complete the following inside your script.

- Add the command for creating a `~/research` directory.

- Add the command to start a new file called sys_info.txt with the title "A Quick System Audit Script" in ~/research/sys_info.txt.  The output of each following command should be added as a new separate line to this file.

- Output the current date and time.  Following it should be a blank line.

- Modify each command of the script so that it writes all output to a file called `~/research/sys_info.txt`.


- Add the command for finding `777` files to your script.

- Add a header line "Top 10 Processes."  On the next line, add the command for finding the Top 10 processes to your script.

#### Bonus

Complete the following in your command line environment:

- Manually create a `~/scripts` directory and save your script there. (This should not be part of your script).

- Add your `~/scripts` directory to your `$PATH`.

- Reload your bashrc file.

- Run your script.

- Open `~/research/sys_info.txt` and verify it has the desired output.
