## Solution Guide: Custom Commands

- In the previous activity, you created your first bash script. It contained a series of commands that should save you time during your system audits.

- In this activity, you will continue to make this script more complex by adding a few commands from the first exercise.

- As a bonus, you will save this script to a `scripts` directory and add that directory to your `$PATH` so you can call your script directly on the command line, from any directory.

Completing this activity will require the following:

- Ensure your script from the last activity runs as expected.

- Copy the script to a new file called mk_sys_info.sh.

- Add the new commands listed or modify existing commands in the instructions to your script.

- Move your script to a `~/scripts` directory as `sys_info.sh`.

- Add your `~/scripts` directory to your `$PATH`.

- Run your script to verify it produces the correct output.

This activity turned our script into a custom command and added a script directory to the `$PATH` so that command can be called directly.

To complete this activity, we needed to do the following:

- Ensure that the script from the last activity runs as expected.
- Add the new commands listed in the instructions.
- Save the script in a ~/scripts directory.
- Add that ~/scripts directory to the `$PATH` variable.
- Run the script by calling it's name only.


#### Instructions

Complete the following inside your script.

- Add the command for creating a `~/research` directory.

- `mkdir ~/research 2> /dev/null`
    ```bash
    # Create directory for output
    mkdir ~/research 2> /dev/null
    ```

The 2> /dev/null takes any errors directed to standard error (stderr) and redirects them so that they don't appear.

- Add the command to start a new file called sys_info.txt with the title "A Quick System Audit Script" in ~/research/sys_info.txt.  The output of each following command should be added as a new separate line to this file.

The original script has many of the commands we need in it already.  Those commands are being sent to the screen (stdout) and need to be sent to the file ~/research/sys_info.txt.  If the command exists, then the only change needed is to add `>> ~/research/sys_info.txt` after the command.

- `echo "A Quick System Audit Script" >  ~/research/sys_info.txt`

- Output the current date and time.  Following it should be a blank line.

- `date >> ~/research/sys_info.txt`
- `echo "" >> ~/research/sys_info.txt`

- Modify each command of the script so that it writes all output to a file called `~/research/sys_info.txt`.

- Any commands sending output to the terminal should send that output to the newly created file.
- `echo "Machine Type Info:" >> ~/research/sys_info.txt`
- `echo $MACHTYPE >> ~/research/sys_info.txt`
- `echo -e "Uname info: $(uname -a) \n" >> ~/research/sys_info.txt`
- `echo -e "IP Info: $(ip addr | grep inet | tail -2 | head -1) \n" >> ~/research/sys_info.txt`
- `echo "Hostname: $(hostname -s) " >> ~/research/sys_info.txt`

- Add the command for finding `777` files to your script.

- `echo -e "\n777 Files:" >> ~/research/sys_info.txt`

- `find / -type f -perm 777 >> ~/research/sys_info.txt`

These next two commands are exactly the same as they were in first two exercises. The only thing we are adding is an `echo` command that will give each command's output a heading.

- Add a header line "Top 10 Processes."  On the next line, add the command for finding the Top 10 processes to your script.

- `echo -e "\nTop 10 Processes" >> ~/research/sys_info.txt`
- `ps aux -m | awk {'print $1, $2, $3, $4, $11'} | head >> ~/research/sys_info.txt`


- Add `>> ~/research/sys_info.txt` to each line of your script.

At this point, our script should resemble the following. (Note: Script may vary if the bonus was completed in the last activity.)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir ~/research 2> /dev/null

echo "A Quick System Audit Script" >  ~/research/sys_info.txt
date >> ~/research/sys_info.txt
echo "" >> ~/research/sys_info.txt
echo "Machine Type Info:" >> ~/research/sys_info.txt
echo $MACHTYPE >> ~/research/sys_info.txt
echo -e "Uname info: $(uname -a) \n" >> ~/research/sys_info.txt
echo -e "IP Info: $(ip addr | grep inet | tail -2 | head -1) \n" >> ~/research/sys_info.txt
echo "Hostname: $(hostname -s) " >> ~/research/sys_info.txt
echo -e "\n777 Files:" >>  ~/research/sys_info.txt
find / -type f -perm 777 >> ~/research/sys_info.txt
echo -e "\nTop 10 Processes" >> ~/research/sys_info.txt
ps aux -m | awk {'print $1, $2, $3, $4, $11'} | head >> ~/research/sys_info.txt

```

#### Bonus

Complete the following in your command line environment:

- Manually create a `~/scripts` directory and save your script there. (This should not be part of your script).

In your command line environment, manually create a `~/scripts` directory and save your script there. (This is a great opportunity to chain two commands together to complete a task.)

- `mkdir ~/scripts && cp sys_info.sh ~/scripts`

- Add your `~/scripts` directory to your `$PATH`.

- `echo "export PATH=$PATH:~/scripts" >> ~/.bashrc`

    - `echo` is printing everything that comes next.
    - `"export` allows the variable to be used across different shells.
    - `PATH=` is the assignment of our variable.
    - `$PATH` is calling the variable as it is now. So, the first part of our new variable for `PATH` will be a copy of the old variable `PATH`.
    - `:` is the delimiter used within the `PATH` variable in between each directory path.
    - `~/scripts"` is the directory we are adding and closes out the `echo` command.
    - `>> ~/.bashrc` appends the output from `echo` to the bottom of the `bashrc` file.

- Run `tail -1 bashrc`.

- Your output should be similar to:

    ```bash
    $ tail -1 ~/.bashrc
    PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games:/snap/bin:/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/:/home/user/.local/bin:/home/user/scripts
    ```

- Reload your bashrc file.

-  `source ~/.bashrc`

    Note: we only need to type the name of the script file in order to run it.

- Run your script.

-  `sys_info.sh`

    Futhermore: we can remove the `.sh` file extension to make this more like a command.

We now have a command `sin` that runs all the commands in your script and saves them to an output file.

- Run `mv ~/scripts/sys_info.sh ~/scripts/sin`

- Open `~/research/sys_info.txt` and verify it has the desired output.

- Run `less ~/research/sys_info.txt`


The contents of `sys_info.txt` file should look similar to the following. (Results will vary.)
