## Activity File: Cryptographic Attacks

You will continue your role as a security analyst working for the Hill Valley Police Department.

- Captain Strickland shared some news: they have been secretly capturing and monitoring all the online activity of the Hill Valley detectives.

- They believe that Detective Tannen is the Alphabet Bandit, as Tannen has been recently saving suspicious encrypted files on their computer.

- The captain believes these encrypted files contain evidence that can be used to prosecute Detective Tannen.

- While capturing Detective Tannen's online activity, Captain Strickland was able to capture the following:
    - Detective Tannen's password encryption script, which generates encrypted passwords from plaintext.

    - Detective Tannen's encrypted password, which is **cbzhptmm**.

- Your task is to see if you can figure out the algorithm of the encryption script to figure out Detective Tannen's plaintext password.

- Then, you will try to use Detective Tannen's password to log into their account and gather evidence that they are the Alphabet Bandit.

### Instructions

1. Enter any plaintext into the Password Encrypter and determine the algorithm being used for encryption.

    - To run the password encrypter, run: `python3 encrypter.py`.
  
         *Hint: Try multiple plaintext passwords to help determine the algorithm.*

3. Once the algorithm has been determined for encryption, apply this method in reverse to determine Tannen's plaintext password from his encrypted password, **cbzhptmm**.

4. Apply this password on Tannen's login website to confirm that the password is correct. Look for any hard evidence that suggests Detective Tannen is the Alphabet Bandit. 

    - To test Tannen's Login password, run: `python3 password.py`.

## Solution File: Cryptographic Attacks 

The goal of this activity was to use a chosen-plaintext attack method to crack a password. You used an algorithm that converts plaintext into ciphertext to determine the plaintext of an encrypted text.

1. Enter any plaintext into the Password Encrypter and determine the algorithm being used for encryption.

    - To run the password encrypter, run: `python3 encrypter.py`.
  
         *Hint: Try multiple plaintext passwords to help determine the algorithm.*

- First, download the two scripts (`encrypter.py` and `password.py`) to your virtual machine.
  
- Next, test the `encrypter.py` with several plaintext words to see the results.
  - For example, if you run `python3 encrypter.py`, you will be asked:
      ```
     What is your password?
      ```
  - We will first test:  **hello**. The following is returned:

      ```
      Your Password is: hello
      Your Encrypted Password is: axeeh
      ```

   - We can determine that the letters are being substituted, as both **l**s are substited with an **e**. 

   - We will test it again with one letter, **a**,  to see if we can determine the algorithm. The following is returned:

      ```
       Your Password is: a
       Your Encrypted Password is: t
      ```
   - Since **a** is the first letter in the alphabet, and **t** is the twentieth letter in the alphabet, we can conclude that this algorithm is a Caesar cipher shifting the letter 19 characters. 
   
   - Let's apply this algorithm in reverse for each letter.
     - A good way to do this is to write or type out the whole alphabet and count 19 characters to the left for each letter of the encrypted password.

     - If you pass the letter **a** while counting, start back at the letter **z**.

3. Once the algorithm has been determined for encryption, apply this method in reverse to determine Tannen's plaintext password from his encrypted password, **cbzhptmm**.

    - To test Tannen's Login password, run: `python3 password.py`.
   - Once we apply this to every letter, the plaintext of Detective Tannen's encrypted password (**cbzhptmm**) is decrypted as **jigowatt**.

4. Apply this password on Tannen's login website to confirm that the password is correct. Look for any hard evidence that suggests Detective Tannen is the Alphabet Bandit. 

 - Next we will test out this password by running `python3 password.py`. This will return the following:

      ```
      Hi Mr Tannen,  What is your password (lowercase only) ?
      ``` 
      
  - Enter in the password `jigowatt`, and the following will be returned:
      ```
      Hello Detective Tannen, the last file you accessed is: topsecret.txt.
      ```
