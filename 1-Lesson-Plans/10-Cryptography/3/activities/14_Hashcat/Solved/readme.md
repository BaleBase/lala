## Activity File: Hashcat 

You will continue your role as a security analyst working for the Hill Valley Police Department. 

- You impressed Captain Strickland by logging into Detective Tannen's account. Unfortunately, the file you must access to prove Tannen is the Alphabet Bandit is encrypted on their computer.

- Fortunately, you found a hash on Detective Tannen's computer that will likely lead you to the password for opening the encrypted file: `f31663d6c912b0b1ced885a6c6bbab7c`.

- Your task is to use Hashcat to figure out the plaintext representation of the hash.

- Once you figure out the password, you will open the secret file and see if it contains the evidence needed to convict the Alphabet Bandit.

### Instructions

1. Use Hashcat to determine the plaintext value of the hash found on Detective Tannen's computer.

   - The hash found on Detective Tannen's computer is `f31663d6c912b0b1ced885a6c6bbab7c`.
   
       *Hint: The hashing algorithm was created in 1992 by Ronald Rivest.*

2. With the plaintext password, open the encrypted file with the command `unzip secret.zip` and confirm whether it contains the evidence needed to lock up the Alphabet Bandit. 

## Solution File: Hashcat

 The goal of this activity was to illustrate how Hashcat can be used to determine the plaintext value of a hash. You ran the Hashcat script to determine the password needed to open an encrypted file.

1. Use Hashcat to determine the plaintext value of the hash found on Detective Tannen's computer.

   - The hash found on Detective Tannen's computer is `f31663d6c912b0b1ced885a6c6bbab7c`.
   
       *Hint: The hashing algorithm was created in 1992 by Ronald Rivest.*

- First, we place the hash into a file.

  - We will place it into a file called `hash.txt` by running the following:

    - `echo f31663d6c912b0b1ced885a6c6bbab7c > hash.txt`

  - Run the command and preview the file to confirm the hash has been placed inside:  
  
    - `more hash.txt`

- Next, write the Hashcat command:
  
  - `hashcat -m 0 -a 0 -o solved.txt hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force`

- The syntax is:
  - `hashcat`: The command to execute Hashcat.
  - `-m 0`: Uses the MD5 hash (which was created by Ronald Rivest in 1992).
  - `a 0`: Applies a dictionary attack.
  - `-o solved.txt`: Creates an output file called `solved.txt`. 
  - `hash.txt`: The input file of the hash.
  - `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`: The location of the wordlist we will check against.
  - `--force`: Overrides any small errors that may occur.

- Run the command. This will place the results in the file called `solved.txt`.

- Open the `solved.txt` file. It tells us that the hash represents the value `ilovelorraine`:

   - `f31663d6c912b0b1ced885a6c6bbab7c:ilovelorraine`

2. With the plaintext password, open the encrypted file with the command `unzip secret.zip` and confirm whether it contains the evidence needed to lock up the Alphabet Bandit. 

- Open the file `secret.zip` using the command `unzip secret.zip`. 

- When it prompts for the password, enter `ilovelorraine`.

- This reveals the Alphabet Bandit's confession letter:

```
CONGRATULATIONS TO THE CYBER SLEUTH THAT FINDS THIS MESSAGE!!


My Confession

  I, Detective Tannen, am confessing that I am the Alphabet Bandit! 

  I am the one solely responsible for all of the Hill Valley Break-ins.

  Since I wasn't promoted to Captain, I have been determined to cause havoc to the Hill Valley community and tie up the Hill Valley Resources.

  Unfortunately, since you have found this message, I will assume that I will be prosecuted and the break-ins will cease.

Sincerely,
Detective Tannen
```
