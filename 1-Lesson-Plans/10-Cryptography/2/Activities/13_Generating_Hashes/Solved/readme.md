## Activity File: Generating Hashes

In this activity, you will continue to be a security analyst working for the Hill Valley Police department.

- Captain Strickland believes that the Alphabet Bandit, who is likely an insider, has been changing the investigation report files to throw off the investigation.

- Fortunately, the Hill Valley Police Department has backup files of all the investigation reports.

- Captain Strickland would like you to determine if any investigation report files have been changed, as well as _what_ was changed.

- Your task is to generate hashes of each backup and current file and compare the hashes to determine which files were changed.

- You must then use command-line tools to determine the changes made to those files.

### Instructions:

1. Extract the investigation files provided to you.

  - Note that there are directories titled `current` and `backup`, each of which contain the investigation report files.

     - It's quite likely that the Alphabet Bandit modified the data in the current files.

2. Use `md5sum` to generate hashes of all the files into a single file called `hashes`.

3. Compare the hashes with a single `md5sum` command to determine which of the files were changed in the `current` directory.

4. Use the `diff` command to figure out what was changed in the modified files.

## Solution Guide: Generating Hashes

The goal of this exercise was to use hashes to validate the integrity of data.  You were tasked with generating MD5 hashes to determine which files were modified.

1. Extract the investigation files provided to you.

  - Note that there are directories titled `current` and `backup`, each of which contain the investigation report files.

     - It's quite likely that the Alphabet Bandit modified the data in the current files.

- Extract the investigation summary files.

- Navigate to the backup directory:

  - Run `cd /Alphabet_Bandit_Investigation_Reports/backup`
         
2. Use `md5sum` to generate hashes of all the files into a single file called `hashes`.

- Create a single hash file for all of the files:

  - `md5sum * > hashes`
      
- Preview the hash file:

    - `more hashes`
      
- The file should look like:

  ```    
  94d53dff0ba90e465fcf1e7b900ec843 *Investigation_1101
  abf9816ba8e141b301848e09038ed1f8 *Investigation_1108
  3edab292de508c37fc8aeb5fd973d54b *Investigation_1110
  609c6b71a2241e1b8f878c682d138c2d *Investigation_1112
  2147a20472c421f2b9af8250d742bbd1 *Investigation_1116
  ```

- Copy the hash file to the `current` folder:

   - `mv hashes ../current/`
    
- Navigate to the `current` folder:

  - `cd ..`
  - `cd current`
      
3. Compare the hashes with a single `md5sum` command to determine which of the files were changed in the `current` directory.

- Run the following command to compare the hashes from the backup folder and the current folder:

  - `md5sum -c hashes`
      
- The results should clearly show the two files are different (`Investigation_1101` and `Investigation_1110`):
 
  ```
  Investigation_1101: FAILED
  Investigation_1108: OK
  Investigation_1110: FAILED
  Investigation_1112: OK
  Investigation_1116: OK
  md5sum: WARNING: 2 computed checksums did NOT match
  ```
          
4. Use the `diff` command to figure out what was changed in the modified files.

- Next, since we know which two files were modified, run the following `diff` commands to find out what was changed:

  - `diff Investigation_1101 ../backup/Investigation_1101`
  - `diff Investigation_1110 ../backup/Investigation_1110`
           
- The results should show:

  - `1101`:
      ```
      < Dr Browns Residence was burglarized, exotic car was taken as well as several containers of Plutonium.
        ---
      > Dr Browns Residence was burglarized, exotic car was taken as well as several containers of Gasoline
      ```
  - `1110`

    ```
      < Jennifer Parkers House was burglarized, mostly jewelry was stolen and significant damage occurred at the house
        ---
      > Jennifer Parkers House was burglarized, mostly jewelry was stolen and no damage occurred at the house
    ```      

- These outputs show the following changes:

  - In the `1101` file, the word  `Plutonium` was changed to `Gasoline`.
  
  - In the `1110` file, the word  `significant` was changed to `no`.
