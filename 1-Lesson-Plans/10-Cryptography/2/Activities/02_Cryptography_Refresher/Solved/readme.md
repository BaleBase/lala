## Activity File: Cryptography Refresher

In this upcoming activity you will use your Key and IV that you had created in the previous class, and had saved into a file called `key_and_IV`. 

- You will continue to act as a security analyst working for the Hill Valley Police Department.

- Captain Strickland has moved a meeting to 6:00 p.m. and would like you to notify your partner of this change.

- As secrecy is still critical, your task is to write an updated message, and encrypt it with OpenSSL.

- Next, send the encrypted message to your partner with your key and IV (initialization vector), and decrypt the message you receive from your partner.

### Instructions

1. Choose a partner, preferably the same partner as in the previous class.

2. Write an updated message using your code name, indicating the meeting is now at 6:00 p.m. at Lou's Cafe.
    - Encrypt the message with OpenSSL.
    - Send the encrypted message to your partner with the key and IV.
    - Once you received your partner's encrypted message, key, and IV, decrypt it with Open SSL.

3. After decrypting your partner's message, answer the following questions:
    - What method did you use to transfer the key and IV?
    - Is this a secure method for transmitting the key and IV? Why or why not?

## Solution Guide: Cryptography Refresher
The goal of this exercise was to review how to use OpenSSL and illustrate the challenge that securely exchanged keys pose to security professionals.

2. Write an updated message using your code name, indicating the meeting is now at 6:00 p.m. at Lou's Cafe.
    - Encrypt the message with OpenSSL.
    - Send the encrypted message to your partner with the key and IV.
    - Once you received your partner's encrypted message, key, and IV, decrypt it with Open SSL.

3. After decrypting your partner's message, answer the following questions:
    - What method did you use to transfer the key and IV?
    - Is this a secure method for transmitting the key and IV? Why or why not?

- Write a message (you can use Nano or Vi) to create a message  titled `meetingplace_update.txt` containing the following information:

    ```
    Dear [partner's code name]

    Captain Strickland would like us to now meet at Lou's Cafe at 6 p.m. to discuss some additional information about the Alphabet Bandit. See you there!

    From, 
    [your code name]
    ```               
 - Use OpenSSL to encrypt the message by running the following:
 
    `openssl enc -pbkdf2 -nosalt -aes-256-cbc -in meetingplace_update.txt -out meetingplace_update.txt.enc -base64 -K <your_key> -iv <your_iv>`
               
 - Send the following to your partner:
      - `meetingplace_update.txt.enc`
      - Key
      - IV
     
- Upon receiving your partner's message, key, and IV, decrypt the message with the following command, updated with your partner's key and IV in the correct locations:

    `openssl enc -pbkdf2 -nosalt -aes-256-cbc -d -in meetingplace_update.txt.enc -base64 -K [partner key] -iv [partner IV]`
           
3. After decrypting your partner's message, answer the following questions:
    - What method did you use to transfer the key and IV?
    - Is this a secure method for transmitting the key and IV? Why or why not?

- It's likely that most of you used Slack or email to transmit the key and IV. While Slack and email may seem secure:
        
    - Emails are typically not encrypted.
    - Slack administrators can have access to view private messages between parties.
