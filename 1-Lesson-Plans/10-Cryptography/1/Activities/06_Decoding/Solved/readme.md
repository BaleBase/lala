## Solution File: Decoding  

1. View the message left at the Mayor's house, provided in the TXT file. Use one of the following websites to decode the message:
    - [Browserling](https://www.browserling.com/tools/hex-to-text)
    - [Rapid Tables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-ascii.html)

In this activity, you were asked to decode a character-encoded message  left at the Mayor's house. 

This activity required the following steps:

  - Reviewing encoded data to determine what type of encoding was applied.

  - Using web resources to decode a message.

Open the TXT file containing the code from the message left at Mayor's house. The code is in hex. 

- To decode the message, we can use the [Browserling Hex-to-Text converter](https://www.browserling.com/tools/hex-to-text).
   
  - Once decoded, it shows:
   
    `Ha Ha Ha! You can never catch the Alphabet Bandit! See if you can follow me here: 01101000 01110100 01110100 01110000 00111010 00101111 00101111 01110111 01110111 01110111 00101110 01110000 01100001 01100111 01100101 01101111 01110010 01100001 01101101 01100001 00101110 01100011 01101111 01101101 00101111 00111111 01110000 00111101 01100001 01100010 01110101 01110010 01100111 01101100 01100001 01110010`
   
- This message includes a code in binary, so we'll have to use the [Browserling Binary-to-Text converter](https://www.browserling.com/tools/binary-to-text). 
 
  - Once decoded, it shows:
 
     `http://www.pageorama.com/?p=aburglar`
