## Activity File: Caesar Cipher Code Names

You will play the role of a security analyst working for the Hill Valley Police Department.

- There has been a number of burglaries in Hill Valley by the mysterious Alphabet Bandit. You've been assigned to a top secret task force to apprehend this criminal.

- Since anonymity is critical, the Hill Valley police captain would like you to create a code name, encrypt it, and share it only with your partner. 

### Instructions

1. Choose a partner. 

2. Think of a code name that will be used for future communications. (Please keep it appropriate).

  - You can use the [Fantasy Name Generators website](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/code-names.php) to come up with a clever name.

3. Use the Caesar cipher with a **key of three** to encrypt your code name. 

4. Send the encrypted code name to your partner using Slack.

5. Receive and decrypt your partner's encrypted code name.

## Solution Guide: Caesar Cipher Code Names

In this activity, you had to create and encrypt a code name, and decrypt your partner's code name.

The following solution uses the example code name of **Blue Fox**.

- For encryption, we will use a key of three to shift the letters down three in the alphabet.

- The first letter, **B** will be shifted three letters to become **E**.

- The next letter, **l** will be shifted three letters to become **o**.

- If we continue this pattern for each letter, the encrypted name will be **Eoxh Ira**.

As an example for decryption, we will use a different encrypted name, **Vwhho Kdzn**.

- For deciphering, we will apply the key in reverse, shifting the letters three to the left. 

- The first letter, **V** will be shifted three letters to become **S**.

- The next letter, **w** will be shifted three letters to become **t**.
    
- If we continue this pattern for each letter, the decrypted name will be  **Steel Hawk**.
