## Solution Guide: Intro to Task Manager and CMD

In this activity, you play the role of a junior systems administrator at Good Corp, Inc.

- Throughout the day, you will be working on a report about this Windows machine. You will start the report in this activity.

- A senior software developer who recently left the company left behind a Windows workstation that was never centrally managed by IT. 

- Your CIO has requested that you do the following on the Windows workstation:

   - Use Task Manager to clean up running and startup processes.

   - Use CMD to create a simple text file in the `%USERPROFILE%\Desktop` directory called `report.txt` and begin appending Windows system information to it.

Make sure you're logged into the **Windows RDP Host Machine** with the following credentials:

- Username: `azadmin`
- Password: `p4ssw0rd*`

This activity allowed you to familiarize yourself with ending processes and executing basic command-line operations.

### Instructions 

1. Use Task Manager to end the following processes (tasks) if they are running:

   - Apple Push
   - iCloud Services
   - iPod Service
   - iTunesHelper
   - Skype
   - Apple Push
   - TeamViewer 

    **Note**: There may be multiple of these tasks, such as the Skype instances.

   - Press **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**Del** or navigate to Task Manager through the Start menu. 

   - Once Task Manager is open, navigate to the Process tab and click the **Name** column to sort by process name.

   - If running, select each of the following processes and click **End Task**.

      - Apple Push
      - iCloud Services
      - iPod Service
      - iTunesHelper
      - Skype
      - Apple Push
      - TeamViewer (if it's still running)


2. Use Task Manager to disable all startup processes, except for the following:

   -  Microsoft OneDrive
   -  Windows Security notification icon

   Disable startup processes. Within the Startup tab, select each startup process and disable it, except for the following:

   - Microsoft OneDrive
   - Windows Security notification icon


3. Using the Windows command line, create a `reports` folder on the user's desktop where you'll store your findings.

   - **Note**: You'll likely want to save all of your working commands to a text file for reference. This way, if you mess up your report, you can delete it easily and re-run the working commands.

  - Run `cd C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Desktop` to navigate into the directory where we will create our report. We'll create the report in the next step. 

4.  Print a line that reads `Baselining Report` and output it to a new `report.txt` file. This will create a title within your report.

  - Run `echo Baselining Report > report.txt` to create a report titled `report.txt`.


5. Print another line titled `Created by [your name here]` and append it to the file.

  - Run `echo Created by [your name here] >> report.txt` to add the subtitle.

Verify your commands worked by entering `type report.txt`.


6. Using ENV variables append the machine's operating system, date, and username to our report:

   - Add the OS, date, and user to the report using the command line.  Use the following format and refer to the reference table below: 
   
   - `[operating system] system report created on [today's date] with logged in user, [current username]`  

      | Environment Variable | Default Value          |
      | :------------------- | :--------------------- |
      | `%CD%`                 | Current directory      |
      | `%DATE%`               | Current date       |
      | `%OS%`                 | Windows                |
      |` %ProgramFiles%`     | `C:\Program Files`       |
      | `%ProgramFiles(x86)%`  | `C:\Program Files (x86)` |
      | `%TIME`                | Current time       |
      | `%USERPROFILE%`        | `C:\Users\{username}`    |
      |` %SYSTEMDRIVE%`        | `C:\`                    |
      | `%SYSTEMROOT%`         | `C:\Windows`             |

    - Run `echo %OS% system report created on %DATE% with logged in user, %USERNAME%. >> report.txt`

    - Run `type report.txt`

    - Your output should look like:
    
      ```console
      Baselining Report
      Created by [your name here]
      Windows_NT system report created on Thu 11/14/2019 with logged in user, azadmin.
      ```


#### Bonus

7. Using the ENV variables `%ProgramFiles%` and `%ProgramFiles(x86)%`, list the contents of these directories and append them to the report.

  - Run `dir "%ProgramFiles%" >> report.txt`

  - Run `dir "%ProgramFiles(x86)%" >> report.txt`
