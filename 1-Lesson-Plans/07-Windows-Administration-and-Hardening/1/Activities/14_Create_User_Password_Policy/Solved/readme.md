## Solution Guide: Creating Users and Setting Password Policies

In the previous activity, you used the `net` command-line tool to find various types of information.

- Your CIO noticed the previous password policies were not very strict, and wants to enforce new password policies on this Windows workstation for the next two new users: senior developer Andrew, and sales representative Bob.

- You are tasked with creating a regular user, `Bob`, and an administrative user, `Andrew`, and set the password policies with the following parameters:

  - Maximum password age is 90 days.

  - Minimum password length is 12 characters.

  - Password complexity requirements are enabled.

Continue using the Windows RDP Host machine. 

In this activity, you used `net` to create two different kinds of users: a regular `user` and a `localgroup` Administrator user, and set new password policies. 

### Instructions

1. Create a regular user, `Bob`, using the `net user` command-line tool.

    - Run `net user Bob /add`

2. Set the user's password to `Ilovesales123!`.
    - Note that you can use `net user [username] *` to change the password of an existing user (if you added the user without setting the password, or set it improperly). 

      - `net user Bob *` will also let you change the password of an existing user (if you added the user without setting the password).

3. Create a user, `Andrew`, with the password `Ilovedevelopment123!` using a one line command. They will change this on their first logon.

  - Run `net user Andrew Ilovedevelopment123! /add /logonpasswordchg:yes`

4. Add Andrew to the `Administrators` group.

  - Run `net localgroup administrators Andrew /add`

5. Use `net` to verify that Andrew is in the `Administrators` group.

  - Run `net user Andrew`

6. Launch `gpedit` and set the following password policies for the entire Windows machine:

    - Maximum password age is 90 days.

    - Minimum password length is 12 characters.

    - Password complexity requirements are enabled.

  - Run `gpedit` and under **Computer, Configuration**, navigate to **Windows Settings** > **Security Settings** > **Account Policies** > **Password Policies**. Set the following:

    - Set maximum password age to 90 days. While **Maximum password age** is highlighted, right-click it, and click on **Properties** to see the tabs for enabling and disabling the option. You can also go to the **Explain** tab to see what best practices exist for password expiration policies.
    
    - Set minimum password length to 12 characters.
    
    - Double-click on **Password must meet complexity requirements**, and set to **Enabled**. Select **Apply**, then click the **Explain** tab to read the following:

  ```console
  Password must meet complexity requirements

  This security setting determines whether passwords must meet complexity requirements.

  If this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements:

  Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two consecutive characters
  Be at least six characters in length
  Contain characters from three of the following four categories:
  English uppercase characters (A through Z)
  English lowercase characters (a through z)
  Base 10 digits (0 through 9)
  Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %)
  Complexity requirements are enforced when passwords are changed or created.
  ```
